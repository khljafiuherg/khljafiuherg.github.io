	<p><strong>Fate/Grand Order</strong>: is <strong>a Japanese free-to-play game</strong> (based on the Type-Moon Fate/stay night series) <strong>for mobile</strong> developed by Rasenguru using the Unity game engine.</p><p>Is a <strong>turn-based role-playing game</strong> with visual novel elements. Players <strong>assume the role of Master and control Minions</strong>, who are usually historical, literary or mythological characters <strong>from different cultures</strong>. In each battle, the player controls a team of up to six minions, three active and three reserve.</p><p>This game is for those who <strong>challenge the history</strong> of mankind and <strong>fight against fate in defense of the human species</strong>.</p><p></p><p><br>Brief synopsis of the game<br><br>Chaldea, the organization that watches over the future of Earth, confirms that the history of mankind will end in 2019. All the future promised in 2017 will disappear without warning.<br><br>For the first time in history, an unexplored region appears. Assuming that this is the cause of humanity's extinction, Haldir conducts his sixth experiment making use of the forbidden ritual that turns humans into Spiritrons and sends them into the past.<br><br>By interfering with events, they discover, identify and destroy singularities in space-time.<br><br></p><p><br><strong>Mechanics</strong><br><br>Each turn, five Command Cards are dealt and up to three can be used for attacks per turn. Each minion has five cards available to the player. All minion cards on the field are shuffled each turn and dealt to the player.<br><br>There are three types of cards: Buster (heavy attacks), Arts (medium attacks) and Quick (light attacks). A chain is formed when three similar cards are matched, which gives a bonus based on the nature of the cards. If three cards corresponding to the same minion are selected, a Brave Chain is generated, allowing for an even more powerful attack at the end.<br><br>Each minion also has an ability that can be used before drawing a Command Card, and each ability has an effect during combat, as well as a special Command Card called -Noble Ghost- that appears when the meter is full.<br><br>In addition, -Masters- have separate special skills and abilities called -Command Spells-, which have different effects depending on the time and are charged in the real world.<br><br>Servants can be obtained through the gacha mechanism. Sacred Quartz, an in-game currency available through in-game and in-app purchases with real money, is used to summon new minions and to obtain -crafting essences- that provide additional effects when equipped to minions.<br><br>These summonings are random, with some minions available frequently and others only rarely. Another currency is -friendship points-, which are easy to obtain but can only be acquired by common minions.</p>
