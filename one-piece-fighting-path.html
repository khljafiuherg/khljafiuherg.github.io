	<p>This is an official One Piece game in which you can control Luffy and relive the original story from the beginning, from the day Monkey D. Luffy leaves the village of Fosha with the dream of becoming a Pirate King. In the tutorial, you will meet Coby and fight against Lady Alvida's minions. All this takes place while you learn the basics of the game and travel through East Blue.<br><br>The action in One Piece. Fighting Path is divided into two parts: exploration of scenarios on foot or by boat and real-time battles. While exploring the world of One Piece, players can converse with NPCs and other players, search for items in the environment and complete quests that require specific conditions.<br><br>An immersive action role-playing game. You control up to three characters in a 3D scenario, using the camera, the joystick on the left of the screen to move and the action buttons on the right to control them, just as in other anime games. The role-playing game uses the classic rock-paper-scissors method to determine which character has an advantage or disadvantage over another. So you have to create a well-balanced team of characters that can survive any challenge.<br><br>In ONE PIECE Fighting Path English version, you will have fun using legendary moves such as Luffy's Rubber Gathering and Zoro's Lion's Head. In addition, there are a number of characters with whom you can form an unbeatable team by progressing through the game's story mode or through the gacha system. These heroes can be upgraded with various items and skill trees, allowing you to increase your strength in any area you wish.<br><br>The technical aspects of this RPG are excellent and on par with other anime games I've seen on mobile. FIGHTING PATH is dubbed after the original series and features 3D graphics that look like they are straight out of the anime. When it comes to fighting, the game also stands out for the fluidity of its animations.<br><br>This action-adventure RPG is a fantastic adaptation of the world of Luffy and his friends for cell phones. The game includes missions to complete, different game modes and an infinite number of characters that you can control directly. It's time to become a member of the Strawberry Clan and enjoy the world of ONE PIECE Fighting Path.</p>
